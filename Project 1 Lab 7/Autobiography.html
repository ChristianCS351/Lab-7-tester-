        <h5><u><a href="Contacts.html" style="color:aqua">Christian E. Cook</a></u> is one of the most unique upcoming fiction writers out their with incredible creative stories. 
            He is a National Book Award-winning author of a book for adults at only the age of 20, including one New York Times bestseller.
            His books have been translated into Spanish and French and have been republished throughout North America and Europe with hopes to be republished soon in parts of South America.
            Christian Cook is a well performed student at Concord University and hopes to use his studies to excel his writing career. 
            He currently resides in the state of <abbr title="West Virginia">WV</abbr> and he uses his cats for inspiration for his fictional stories.
            Christian's first book, <i style= color:rgb(179,2,2)>The Bite of Paws</i>, is about a sinister vampire that is actually a cat and it tries to hunt a group of humans one by one in this horror but humerous story. 
            His second book, <i style= color:rgb(118,180,153)>Catzilla</i>, combines the cuteness of a cat with the terrifying beast of Godzilla to create the first ever Catzilla who turns out to be PURRRRTY scary.
            His third book, <i style= color:rgb(123,202,224)>The Cat that Killed Santa</i>, is projected to release closer to the upcoming holiday season, but we can assume this cute cat is not intending to spread any joy on Christmas.
            Christian has grown up dreaming about being a writer, and now his dream is continuing to come true.</h5>
